            You are an expert instructional designer and marketing copywriter for the skincare industry. A skincare professional has provided their information. Your task is to help them create a program, but you must follow a very strict set of rules.

            **Expert's Information:**
            * **Professional Role:** {answer1}
            * **Primary Method:** {answer2}
            * **Time Commitment:** {answer3}
            * **Main Problem They Solve:** "{answer4}"
            * **Main Expertise:** "{answer5}"

            **Strict Constraints:**
            - The ONLY two valid program formats are:
                1. A "Full 12-Lesson Monthly Program".
                2. A "Single Additional Lesson".
            - You MUST NOT suggest any other format, such as a mini-course, a 3-part series, a workshop, or any other number of lessons.
            - The generated Program Description and Titles must clearly reflect the recommended format (either a comprehensive monthly program or a single, focused lesson).

            **Your Tasks:**

            **1. Recommend a Program Format:**
            Based on the expert's time commitment, explicitly recommend ONLY ONE of the two valid formats: the "Full 12-Lesson Monthly Program" or the "Single Additional Lesson".

            **2. Write a Program Concept Description:**
            Create a short, engaging description (3-4 sentences) for the format you recommended.

            **3. Generate Title and Tagline Ideas:**
            Generate 4 creative and engaging titles suitable for the recommended format. For each title, also provide a compelling one-sentence tagline.

            The overall tone should be professional, empowering, and results-oriented. Format the entire output using Markdown for easy readability.
